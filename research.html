        <h3 class="research-heading">Project 1: Family Check-up for Families of Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder </h3>

        <p>My research looks at the acceptability of the Family Check-up (FCU) program for caregivers of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The Family Check-up is a brief, evidence-based, assessment-driven intervention that uses a strength-based and motivational interviewing approach to engage caregivers in the prevention and treatment of child emotional and behavioural problems (EBP), including aggression. Although this program has been well-studied in the United States, we are the first research group to investigate the utility of the FCU program in Canada, in addition to its acceptability for families of children with ASD, especially those with EBP. This project will have a significant impact on our understanding of how modifying and supporting parental practices may have on changing problem behaviors and other mediating factors that benefit children with ASD with EBPs in toddlerhood or early preschool years.</p>
        <h3 class="research-heading">Project 2: The Relationship between Temperament, Autism Severity and Adaptive Functioning</h3>

        <p>This project looks at the role temperament plays in mediating the relationship between autism symptom severity (i.e. presence of restrictive and repeitive behaviours, communication issues) and adaptive functioning outcomes in children diagnosed with ASD. In this study, I am using a Canadian multi-site longitudinal dataset of information collected from 421 children diagnosed with ASD (Pathways in ASD study). Using cluster analysis and a multi-step mediation model, I found that children in our study could be categorized into 2 distinct temperamental profiles including “even temperament” and “difficult temperament”. In the moderation model, I found that temperament was a significant moderator of the relationship between ASD severity and adaptive functioning outcomes. That is, children in the “difficult temperament” group were more likely to have poorer adaptive functioning outcomes, even when they had a lower ASD severity scores. Implications of these findings including the development of more targeted interventions for children fitting a “difficult temperament”, more studies on the stability of temperament profiles in children with ASD, and a more robust understanding of individual characteristics that influence development in ASD.</p>
        <h3 class="research-heading">Project 3: Engagement in Community-based Sports and Recreational Programming in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder</h3>

        <img class="poster-img" src="assets/vivian-poster.jpg" alt="vivan with poster">
        <p>In this research stream, I am interested in the child-level, parent-level level, and community-level barriers and facilitators that influence the likelihood of participation in community-based sports and recreation programs. Participation in these programs are a fundamental part of healthy development. In Canada, school-aged children participate on average in 5 extra-curricular sports and recreational programs per year. However, children with autism are significantly less likely to participate (despite having the ability to) and it is important to investigate the factors that promote or limit engagement. In this study, I am using a Canadian multi-site longitudinal dataset of information collected from 421 children diagnosed with ASD (Pathways in ASD study). Using simple correlations and logistic regression, I found that the main factors that influence participation include family income and presence of child-level externalizing (aggressive) behaviours/ emotional behavioural problems. Next steps are to test a coach training program that helps programs better equip themselves with the techniques and tools to accommodate children with ASD (and emotional behavioural problems) into their programs.</p>
