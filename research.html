        <h3 class="research-heading">Project 1: Family Check-up for Families of Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder </h3>

        <p class="about">My research looks at the acceptability of the Family Check-up (FCU) program for caregivers of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The Family Check-up is a brief, evidence-based, assessment-driven intervention that uses a strength-based and motivational interviewing approach to engage caregivers in the prevention and treatment of child emotional and behavioural problems (EBP), including aggression. <a href="https://offordcentre.com/research/studies-currently-recruiting-volunteers/making-race-fair-study/">First, we are investigating the efficacy of the FCU within a Canadian mental healthcare setting.</a> Second, I am leveraging the established FCU training and intervention protocol to investigate the utility of the FCU program for families of children with ASD, especially those with EBP. This project will have a significant impact on improving our understanding about how modifying and supporting positive parenting practices can benefit the emotional and behavioural well-being of children living with ASD.</p>

        <h3 class="research-heading">Project 2: The Relationship between Temperament, Autism Severity and Adaptive Functioning</h3>

        <p class="about">This project looks at the relationship between temperament, autism symptom severity (i.e. presence of restrictive and repetitive behaviours, communication issues) and adaptive functioning outcomes in children diagnosed with ASD. In this study, I am using a Canadian multi-site longitudinal dataset collected from 421 children diagnosed with ASD (<a href=” http://www.asdpathways.ca/2018/home”>Pathways in ASD study</a>). In a series of studies, I investigate temperament profiles in children and youth diagnosed with ASD, and the implications these temperamental profiles on individual adaptive functioning outcomes and family wellbeing. Implications of these findings include the development of targeted interventions for children fitting certain profiles of temperament, and having a more robust understanding of individual characteristics that influence development in ASD.</p>

        <h3 class="research-heading">Project 3: Engagement in Community-based Sports and Recreational Programming in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder</h3>

        <img class="poster-img" src="assets/vivian-poster.jpg" alt="vivan with poster">
        <p class="about">In this research stream, I am interested in the child-, parent-, and community-level barriers and facilitators that influence the likelihood of participation in community-based sports and recreation programs. Participation in these programs are a fundamental part of healthy development. A <a href="https://nationalpost.com/pmn/news-pmn/children-with-disabilities-need-better-access-to-sport">recent report</a> indicated that children with physical and behavioural challenges (including ASD) are critically underserved in terms of community-based physical activity programs. Therefore, it is important to investigate the factors that promote or restrict engagement. In this series of studies, I am using a Canadian multi-site longitudinal dataset from the Pathways in ASD study to investigate individual, family, and contextual factors that influence participation in community-based sports and recreation programs. At the same time, I am interested in investigating the needs of community-based programs and exploring how best to implement evidence-based training programs to better support them in  accommodating children of all abilities into their programs.</p>
