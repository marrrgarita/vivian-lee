        <h2>Welcome!</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>I am currently a Brain Canada- Kids Brain Health Network Postdoctoral Fellow and a member of the Offord Centre for Child Studies, within the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioural Neuroscience at McMaster University. In this capacity, I am working alongside my postdoctoral supervisors, Dr. Ellen Lipman and Dr. Teresa Bennett on implementing and evaluating the Family Check-Up (FCU) preventative intervention for children and youth with behavioural-emotional challenges (Making the Race Fair Study). We are the first research-clinician collaborative team to deliver and test the FCU within a Canadian mental health setting. In addition, I am leveraging the expertise and established infrastructure for the Making the Race Fair study, and leading the investigation into the feasibility and acceptability of the FCU for families of children and youth diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder.</p>

        <p>My transdiciplinary training includes psychometry (developmental and psychoeducational assessments), developmental psychology, population and health research methodology, policy development, with specialized training in advanced multivariate modelling, implementation science, and mixed methods research. These diverse opportunities informs my present line of investigation: of children with and without autism and/or intellectual disabilities, the influence of temperament and emotional-behaivoural challenges on family and child well-being, and assessing family-centred preventative interventions to address these challenges. </p>
